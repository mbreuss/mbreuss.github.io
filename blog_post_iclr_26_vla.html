          Every year in autumn, the deadline for ICLR submissions looms over the machine learning community.
          Unlike NeurIPS or ICML, ICLR publicly releases all anonymous submissions a few weeks after the deadline, 
          giving a unique real-time snapshot of ongoing research around the world without the half year delay of all other top ml conferences.  
          Given my personal research interests, I wanted to look into <strong>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models</strong> research.<br><br>

          Given the papers I found interesting, I wanted to share my findings about current trends and problems in our field and highlight some interesting papers.
          To help people better understand the current state of VLA research, I also included a short guide on how to interpret benchmark results in VLA papers.
          Finally, there is a brief discussion about the hidden gap between frontier labs and research labs in the VLA field, that is not visible from reading papers.<br><br>

          Below is a summary of general research trends with some highlighted papers for each category that I found interesting from this years submission.
          Please note that this is only a personal selection and personal opinion of papers and research and I might have missed a lot of other interesting work.
          If you find any noteworthy papers that I missed, please let me know.<br><br>

          Some general interesting observations about the growth of VLA research based on key-word search for VLA papers: 
          In 2024 it was only 1 rejected submission "Vision-Language-Action" appearing in the key-word search on openreview.
          In 2025 there were 6 accepted papers and 3 rejected ones with same key-word.
          For 2026 openreview shows 164 submissions with the same keyword. 
          Given the exponential growth, I am excited to review the 2,100 VLA ICLR submissions next year.

        </p>

        <h2>Summary of Key Trends</h2>
        <p>By scanning and reading most of the ICLR 2026 submissions with the VLA keyword, I identified the following key trends in VLA research with a lot of overlap in between these categories:</p>

        <p>
          So you are reading a new VLA paper and want to understand how good the results are?
          In order to better understand the VLA results, it is important to have some context on the current state of popular VLA benchmarks and what good performance looks like.
          Given the current benchmark there is no clear statement possible to say which model is the best, as most papers only compare against each other on the usual simulation benchmarks.
          90% of papers mentioned in this post all test in either <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03310" target="_blank">LIBERO</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LZh48DTg71" target="_blank">SIMPLER</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03227" target="_blank">CALVIN</a>.<br><br>
          LIBERO is basically solved and showing 99% vs 98% is not very helpful and you don't need VLAs and large-scale pretraining to get competetive results.
          E.g. all mentioned concurrent discrete diffusion policies below test on LIBERO and all achieve between 95-98% average over the 4 versions (Goal, Spatial, Long, Object).
          Based on these results it is impossible to say which model is better, as they are all very close to the ceiling anywayys and you dont need internet scale pretraining to solve these.<br><br>
          Rule of thumb for getting a impression a VLA is decent or near sota levels on these: LIBERO: >95% is expected for Spatial, Goal and Object, 90-95% is required for Long and 90, lower than 90% is only decent for non-wrist came or few-shot stuff.
          A properly tuned Diffusion Policy can get you there without VLAs altough the most cited DP baselines is showing worse results. 
          CALVIN is also almost saturated by current sota models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04996">FLOWER</a>.
          For CALVIN higher than 4 score for ABC is standard now and above 4.5 is sota regime. 
          For the D version 3.75 is standard and above 4 is very good. 
          For the ABCD version results above 4.6 are relevant.<br><br>
          SIMPLER is kind of in a weird spot and I don't know if progress there translates to real world. The bridge version ranges from 40% up to 99% success rate, making it hard to judge. 
          For the Google Robot version current sota models achieve around 70%-80% success rate. 
          Somehow, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12271" target="_blank">RLBench</a> (the most popular 3d policy benchmark) has gained more popularity in VLA benchmarking, but all VLAs are still far away from 3D SOTA methods like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10885" target="_blank">3DDA</a>. 
          Most VLA policies try to avoid comparing against all relevant 3D baselines for some reason. 
          Any real world results are very important and more is better, as sim-only is hard to trust especially with VLA papers that use models with 7B+ parameters and are very prone to overfitting successfully on these benchmarks.<br><br>

        <h2 id="discrete-diffusion">1. Discrete Diffusion VLAs</h2>
        <figure class="figure-container">

          <figcaption>Figure 1: Overview of discrete diffusion paradigm for action generation. Image from <a href="https://openreview.net/attachment?id=YWeNCMxdhM&name=pdf">DISCRETE DIFFUSION VLA</a>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Given the success of discrete diffusion models in other domains like text (e.g. <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/eb0b13cc515724ab8015bc978fdde0ad-Paper-Conference.pdf">(MDLM</a>) and VLMs (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16933">LLaDA-V</a>), it is no surprise that this trend is also making its way into VLA research. 
          Why discrete diffusion? Compared to autoregressive models, diffusion models can generate sequences in parallel, which is a big advantage for discrete action token generation. Instead of having to run your policy 100 times, you can generate long action sequences in a few forward passes. 
          In addition, you can combine it with ideas from Embodied Chain-of-Thought (see next section) to generate sub-goals and reasoning together with actions in parallel. 
          This tackles some of the biggest limitations of ECoT from prior work, which was extremely slow due to the autoregressive nature of the VLM models.
          Current attempts for discrete Diffusion either finetune an autoregressive VLM with discrete diffusion because the variety of discrete diffusion VLMs is very limited.
          Other work use LLaDA-V as a pretrained backbone with good sucess.

        <h2 id="embodied-cot">2. Reasoning VLAs and Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT)</h2>
        <p>
          Since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693" target="_blank">the first ECoT paper</a> (CoRL 2024), there has been a growing interest in combining spatially grounded reasoning with action prediction for improving VLAs.
          By combining subtask and bounding box prediction, the VLM gets better representations for embodied stuff and show improved performance on benchmarks.
          Prior results in analysing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08243" target="_blank">ECoT Training </a> show, that these objectives seem to help to bridge the representation gap between VLM pretraining and robotic related task. 
          However, the main limitation of prior ECoT work was the autoregressive nature of the VLAs and its increased token count which result slow in training and inference.
          Overall, it remains an open question how to best implement grounded reasoning for VLAs. 
          Most methods focussing on ECoT still use the same dataset but dont experiment a lot with which type of objectives are ideal.

            This training method is able to bridge the domain gap of VLMs without reducing performance on other VQA benchmarks from pretraining.

          Discrete Action Tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action Models is an open problem which was started by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09747" target="_blank">FAST</a>, showing the potential of discrete tokenizers for easy combination of VLMs with action learning without the more complicated flow/diffusion expert.
          Discrete tokenizers can directly be applied to pretrained VLMs without any architecture modifications. 
          Moreover, the domain gap between VLM pretraining and discrete action tokens is smaller compared to trying to force the VLM to predict velocity fields.
          Before <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09747" target="_blank">FAST</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03181" target="_blank">VQ-VAEs</a> and discrete binning (used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06817" target="_blank">RT-1</a>) have been used, but they have several limitations like low compression ration and struggle to encode long-action chunks given the limited information content of tokens.
          This year there are several interesting new tokenizers that try to tackle these limitations with different approaches.
          New tokenizers combine ideas from Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312" target="_blank">SoundStream</a>) to get a higher compression ratio, B-Splines ideas from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06072" target="_blank">BEAST tokenizer</a> and DCT prediction losses inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09747" target="_blank">FAST</a>.
          Very excited to give them a shot in my own research soon.

            It uses a two stage encoding process: First, aligning the different action chunk lengths of different embodiments into a normalized, fixed-length representation.
            Next, it uses a B-Spline based encoder to get a compact representation of the normalized action chunk. Finally, a VQ-VAE is used to get discrete tokens.

        <p>As someone working on this topic myself, I understand the pain of trying to train and run larger VLAs on limited compute setsups. 
          Thus, efficient VLAs are always relevant. Especially, since this gives labs with limited compute access the chance to work on VLAs too.
          There are several interesting papers this year that try to tackle this problem with different approaches.
          Generally, one can divide them into two categories: try to make training and models more efficient by making smaller VLAs or better tokenizers etc. 
          Otherwise, a lot of papers focus on making inference more efficient by using better quantization, distillation or similar ideas.

          There is a lot of hope for RL to close this gap. 
          While a lot of attempts have been made before, no method has established itself as the go-to method yet.

        <h2 id="vla-video">6. VLA + Video Prediction</h2>
        <p>Started by strong results from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13139" target="_blank">GR-1 paper</a> from ICLR 2024 that showed the potential of video-based policies, there is a growing interest in this subfield.
          These types of policies can be divided into two general categories: starting by a VLM, that optionally has been trained on image generation and continue training it with future frame and action prediciton. 
          Otherwise several papers instead start from a Video Foundation Model and modify it to also generate actions. 
          Since most state-of-the-art video foundation models are diffusion/flow-based these policies typically struggle with slow inference speed. 
          Overall, the results demonstrate that video generation and the required physics understanding and language grounding are a very useful prior for robot learning.
          Compared to VLAs initialized from VLMs this subfield is way less popular and I hope to see more research in this direction.
          What holds back more research in this direction is the high requirements for finetuning sota video models like WAN even compared to finetuning VLM for VLAs.

            <em>TL;DR:</em> Finetunes the Cosmos Video Foundation Model from NVIDIA for action prediction. 
            Core idea is to inject additional modalities like future action chunks or value function estimations into latent token sequence.

          As mentioned above, the current state of VLA benchmarks is quite saturated and it is hard to judge which model is actually better given the limited number of benchmarks and the fact that most papers only compare against a few other baselines.
          Luckily, there are several submission that try to bridge this gap by introducing new benchmarks for VLAs.
          Other ideas include real2sim world models to test policies in generative environments. 
          While I don't think these ideas are on a good enough level yet to be used as real alternatives yet, its a very exciting research area that I hope to see more progress in the future.

        <h2 id="cross-action-space">8. Cross-Action-Space-Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Most VLAs still avoid pretraining on diverse action spaces, given the difficulties of getting any positive transfer results.
          Thus, it is a very exciting research area for current VLAs to improve. 
          In addition, there is a growing interesting in using human egocentric videos with action labels for pretraining VLAs. 
          Datasets like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11709" target="_blank">EgoDex</a> released earlier this year now enable more research in this direction. 
          Several interesting papers are submitted this year that try to tackle this problem with different approaches.
          They either focus on architecture details of VLAs to better handle heterogeneous action spaces or use additional abstractions like motion in image-space to get better transfer.
          It's noteworthy that the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03342" target="_blank">Gemini Robotics 1.5</a> release from DeepMind indicates that a unreleased technique called motion transfer works for them to get positive zero-shot task transfer inbetween action spaces.
          So maybe this is just a data and model scale question. Nevertheless, more research is needed to better understand and tackle these issues.

        <h2 id="other">9. Other Interesting Papers</h2>
        <p>
          There are several other interesting papers that don't fit neatly into the categories above, but are worth mentioning.
          These papers explore various aspects of VLA models, from choice of VLM backbone to including a memory module in the VLA architecture. 
          I especially like the memory idea, as most VLAs just encode the current image and ignore prior timesteps, which is a big limitation for many tasks.
          However natively adding long history does not work well, because they overfit too strong on the history. During rollouts, its unlikely to encounter the same sequence of states than human demonstrators which result in low performance.
          Thus, memory modules that aggregate prior timesteps in a more general way are a very exciting research area.

        <h2 id="frontier-gap">10. The Hidden Gap Between Frontier and Research VLAs</h2>
        <p>
          On paper (pun intended:)), the gap seems small: on simulation setups (LIBERO, CALVIN) open-source VLAs surpass popular frontier baselines like Pi0.5. 
          In practice, there is still a bigger gap that only shows up precisely where current papers rarely evaluate: <em>zero-shot, open-world behavior after pretraining</em>. 
          Two weeks ago at CoRL, the Gemini-Robotics VLA demo attempted a wide range of novel tasks with arbitrary objects and paraphrased language. 
          My own VLA  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04996">FLOWER</a> is state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, but not close to that level of zero-shot robustness. 
          Simulation Benchmarks hide this delta and current simulation setups don't optimize for this objective.<br><br>
          
          This gap is not unique to VLAs, the same is true for LLMs and VLMs.
          For VLAs, fully open-weight models (that share training recipe, data, code and weights) still lag significantly behind closed-weight models like Gemini-Robotics and Pi0.5 on zero-shot tasks.
          This is not to say that open-weight VLAs are useless, they are very useful for research and have strong performance in a lot of scenarios.
          But I wanted to highlight this gap, as I believe it is a significant issue for our community that needs to be addressed in the future.<br><br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Why the gap exists (based on what’s visible from papers, discussion with peers and personal experience):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Benchmark progress saturation masks real progress.</em> When scores cluster near the ceiling, “+0.5%” is not evidence of real improvements.</li>
        <li><em>High quality Data Gap</em> The current available open-source data is limited in diversity and scale, which limits the training of more general models.</li>
        <li><em>Understanding of High Quality Data</em>It's not only the data scale its also about the missing knowledge gap of understanding high quality demonstration data.</li>
        <li><em>Evaluation scope is narrow.</em> Most papers report sim-only or small, locally finetuned setups. 
          Free-form zero-shot language following and unseen objects/rooms are very rare. 
          However, it's important to highlight that proper large-scale evals are only doable by companies.</li>
        <li><em>Operational constraints.</em> Research groups lack the manpower/time to run large, diverse real-world trials necessary for rapid iteration. 
          Frontier labs operate at a different scale of manpower, funding, and robot fleet size.
        Thus, many PhDs, including myself, iterate on simulation benchmarks to test and try out their ideas.</li>
        <li><em>Missing Peer Review Incentives.</em> Reviewers at most major conferences expect head-to-head comparison against open-weight but closed-source trained VLAs on standard sims and strong local finetuning numbers. 
          These benchmarks are good for paper acceptance, but weakly correlated with open-world performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Counterarguments against this thesis:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Research Findings are not equal to performance gains.</em>
          Many great papers I discussed here have general interesting findings useful for the community and research. Zero-shot Performance is only one aspect of Policy Performance.</li>
        <li><em>Evaluation scope is narrow.</em> </li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>Figure 4: Overview of the current <a href="https://robo-arena.github.io/" target="_blank">RoboArena</a> Leaderboard. There is only one non-Pi model that is near to being competitive in zero-shot tasks.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>What would help to bridge this gap without blowing the compute and human manpower budget:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Usage of public zero-shot fair benchmarks.</em> Track progress on setups like <a href="https://robo-arena.github.io/" target="_blank">RoboArena</a> that test post-pretraining generalization by independent operators. 
          Today, non-Pi models are scarcely represented and far behind.</li>
        <li><em>Better Pretraining Recipes.”</em> I've seen only very few papers like <a href="https://openreview.net/attachment?id=kt51kZH4aG&name=pdf">X-VLA</a> that properly ablate all their pretraning design decisions to understand the impact of these for performance. 
        We need more papers like this that share full pretraining recipes and failed ideas that did not work during pretraining.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        I wanna clearly highlgiht, that I don't think simulation or local finetuning are useless for research. 
        Only that they are a poor proxy for the thing for the main argument of VLA: <em>robust zero-shot behavior in messy, new environments</em>.

        <h2 id="summary-outlook">11. Summary and Outlook</h2>

        <p>
          Overall, I am very positive about the current state of VLA research and the progress being made in this field.
          The trends above show strong interest and contributions across VLA models—from architecture design to training strategies and evaluation methods.<br><br>

          However, there are also a few disappointing aspects of the current state of research, apart from the zero-shot gap.<br><br>

          My biggest complaint for the ICLR submissions is the lack of data-focused papers.
          Given the importance of data quality and diversity for training VLAs, I had hoped to see more work in this direction.
          I believe this remains one of the least understood areas of VLA research, and we need better methods to collect and curate high-quality datasets.
          That said, data-centric research is hard.
          It’s an open secret that OXE is mostly low-quality data, and there are only a few large-scale, high-quality datasets.
          Understanding how to quantify data quality in imitation learning is one of the most crucial open problems in VLA research.<br><br>

          Nevertheless, I am optimistic that the field will continue to grow and evolve rapidly.
